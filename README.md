## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
The only thing I learned is to replace

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

```css
div {
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I'll keep on doing newbie level challenges until I finish them all (Even though I'm not newbie). Then I'll move to harder challanges.
